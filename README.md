# OKD Flask App

### Deployment with OKD

1. Create an OKD project. Browse catalog and chose a Python project. Use this repository's HTTPS link as the source.

2. Build and deploy the cluster.

3. Open the .nip.io link OKD gives you to view your app in the browser. If "Hello, World!" appears, the deployment was successful.

4. Now, add /other to the end of the URL. A different message should appear. This demonstrates the implementation of routes.
